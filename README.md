# frelsi
A small file uploader.

Frelsi means "liberty" in Icelandic. I'm french but I want to promote the freedom of web by creating a new cms, 
based on the upload function of php.

Frelsi is a totally-modifiable software. But here are some rules I want :

* First, Frelsi have to be installed on a PHP3 or > environnment.
* Secondly, a database is needed (for users!)
* Third, I love cookies.
* Fourth, everyone can translate the file.
* Fifjfsjd, Frelsi is imo unified and relied with my own server, 'master.gautwe.com' for add note or security patch.
